To install and run the script, simply upload the contents of this directory to a server with PHP support (**PHP 5.0** or higher is required).  
Then, point your browser to the index.php file in that folder. The first time you do this, it will take you to a configuration page.  
To use all the default values, just click the button at the bottom, or customize it however you want.
